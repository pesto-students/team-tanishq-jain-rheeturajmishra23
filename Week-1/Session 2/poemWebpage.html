    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?
        Are you - Nobody - Too?
        Then there's a pair of us!
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
      
        <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody!
        How public - like a Frog -
        To tell one's name - the livelong June-
        To an admiring Bog!</p>

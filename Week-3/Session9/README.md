# Week-3 Session-9 Assignment

### This assignment is on basic Fundamental Javascript.

---
## Problems:

### 1. Create a function named as divideArray() which will take a number array and create different arrays for even and odd number and print the sorted arrays.

### 2. Write a function called playGuessingGame() in script.js that has two parameters:
### - numToGuess is the number that the user has to guess.
### - totalGuesses is the total number of times the user is allowed to guess the number.
### The default value should be 10. The playGuessingGame() function should return the number of guesses the user took to enter the correct number. Ex: If the user guesses the correct number after 3 tries, the function should return 3. If the user does not guess the correct number before the number of guesses exceeds totalGuesses, the function should return 0.

### 3. Write a function isStrongPassword() which should return true only when :
### - Does not contain "password" string
### - Length should be atleast 8.
### - Atleast one character should be in uppercase.

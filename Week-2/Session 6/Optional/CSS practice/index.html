            Yesterday,
            All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
            Now my database has gone away.
            Oh I believe in yesterday.

            Suddenly,
            There's not half the files there used to be,
            And there's a milestone hanging over me. 
            The system crashed so suddenly.

            Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

            Yesterday,
            The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
            I knew my data was all here to stay,
            Now I believe in yesterday.
